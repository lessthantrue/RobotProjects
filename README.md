# Robot Projects

Various robotics related simulation proof of concept projects I've made

Contents:

* Cart Pendulum - Linear feedback controller for a simulated inverted pendulum on a cart
* Double joint arm - 2 joint arm that reads G code to draw to the screen
* Particle with beacon - Simple robot that estimates its position given its distance and heading to a known location
* Particle with many beacons - Same as above, but with many beacons, and estimated with a particle filter instead of an extended Kalman filter
* Ultrasonic localization - A team of robots move around a room in a rigid shape, estimating their position with ultrasonic sensors
